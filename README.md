# Introduction

An Apache HTTPD RewriteMap program for choosing an offload target suitable
for requested URI.

Developed to meet the needs of http://ftp.acc.umu.se/ - the file archive of
Academic Computer Club (ACC), Ume√• University, Sweden. The archive hosts
all kinds of Open Source software ranging from small archive files to
large DVD images.

ftp.acc.umu.se consists of a backend server delivering a shared file system
via NFS to multiple frontend servers running this RewriteMap program to
redirect suitable traffic to dedicated offloader servers.  This RewriteMap
program is aware of the methods used by `mod_cache_disk_largefile`, available
at https://github.com/accumu/mod_cache_disk_largefile, to avoid duplicated
files in the cache and tries to ensure that only one primary offloader is
chosen to handle each file and all its duplicate names.

Among the features are on-the-fly reconfiguration of available redirection
targets, cache-friendly handling of downed offload targets, burst detection of
single-file hotspots and caching of results in a GDBM map to speed up
subsequent requests.

This work eventually became a part of the Master's thesis *Scaling a Content
Delivery system for Open Source Software*, available at

# Installation

Requires perl and a few common modules, see the script for details.

# Setup/config

## Requirements

All offload redirects uses the offload server host names, which implies
that all files should be reachable using the default virtual host. This
means that you have to ensure this is the case.

### DocumentRoot

There must be a base DocumentRoot common to all virtual hosts served
by this server instance.

As an example, consider an mirrors.example.com server that also provides
a distro.example.com mirror for convenience and to fit in with the
distro naming scheme.

mirrors.example.com have DocumentRoot /srv/mirrors

distro.example.com have DocumentRoot /srv/mirrors/distro

`redirprg.pl` can work with this, provided that you ensure that the
invoking RewriteRule adds the missing path component. See the example
files for details.

## Redirprg

The example `redirprg*.conf` files should be used as a base for your
configuration. The format is JSON with comments.

Do note that the config handling is very rudimentary,
and not at all forgiving when it comes to parse errors or missing config
items. Patches welcome :-)

Using the included `test-json.pl` script is recommended to verify syntax
before applying to production hosts.

The script is started by Apache HTTPD, and thus needs to be present
in the Apache HTTPD configuration.

* Document quirks like logs needed and log formats
* Add httpd.conf config snippet
